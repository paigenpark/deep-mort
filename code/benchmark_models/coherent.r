##### Coherent Product-Ratio #####

# The fitting process here is more complex than the other benchmark models

# Because the data for some countries is shorter (less years available)
# we need to fit two rounds of the coherent model

# 1) A coherent product–ratio model is fit on all countries with mortality 
#    time series extending back to 1959 (this excludes five countries, but 
#    includes all years)
# 2) A second coherent model restricted to the common time window
#    across all countries is fit (this includes all countries -- except Germany
#    which was leading to fitting issues, but not all years)

# All forecasts are exported into the same csv file

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Note: The forecast() call below sometimes prints
# 
#   Error in stats::arima(x = …): non-stationary AR part from CSS
 
# Why does this occur?
#   auto.arima() searches many candidate ARIMA orders. Each one is first
#   estimated with conditional-sum-of-squares (“CSS”). If the provisional
#   AR coefficients are outside the stationarity region, stats::arima()
#   throws the message before control returns to R.  The call is wrapped
#   in try(), so execution continues.

#   The candidate that fails is discarded (its IC is set to Inf) and the
#   search moves on.  The winning order is ultimately re-fitted with full
#   maximum likelihood, so the final model is guaranteed stationary.

#   Good forecasts are still produced for every year.
