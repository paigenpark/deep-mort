### Replication Steps

If you want to replicate results from raw data: 

  1. Start with data_preparation files and create clean HMD and USMDB files.
  2. Then split the data.
  3. Train the neural networks using train_models.ipynb.
  4. Save resulting predictions from models of interest.
  5. Train benchmarks using scripts in benchmark_models directory.
  6. Replicate key figures in the working paper using create_figures.ipynb (and create your own by specifying countries of interest)
